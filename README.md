# AC_Milan_csv

Project is used to extract data for the football team AC Milan, from the fbref website and convert into csv format.

The code represents completion of phase one of the project- to extract base data (list of squads and fixures).

The next phase of the project will focus on using the data extracted, as the subject of a loop, to further extract player level data from multiple web sources.

The third phase would be an expansion to other teams and leagues.
